        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. 
                Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, 
                educate, and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. 
                I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless."
            </blockquote>
